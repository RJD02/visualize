REMOVED: lightweight helper to create a browser HTML wrapper for a specific SVG.
This was a temporary convenience script; keep tests and reusable utilities instead.
If you need this again, restore from Git history or reintroduce a focused tool under
`scripts/` that reads arbitrary SVGs from `outputs/` rather than a hard-coded filename.
