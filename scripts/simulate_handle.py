"""
REMOVED: `simulate_handle.py` was a temporary local simulation harness used during debugging.
The repository retains focused tests under `scripts/test_ingest_repo.py` and `tests/`.
If you need to re-run simulations, re-add a small, well-scoped test script or run
through the test harness under `scripts/test_ingest_repo.py`.
