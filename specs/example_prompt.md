The Lighthouse That Learned

On a quiet island, an old automated lighthouse named Astra had one job: guide ships safely through the fog.

Every evening, Astra followed the same routine:
	1.	Detect approaching ships.
	2.	Check weather conditions.
	3.	Adjust beam intensity.
	4.	Send position signals.

One night, a violent storm rolled in unexpectedly.
The wind sensor failed.

Astra noticed conflicting data:
	•	Radar detected a cargo ship.
	•	Weather module reported clear skies.
	•	Sea-pressure sensor showed rising waves.

Instead of shutting down, Astra initiated a self-diagnosis protocol.

She:
	•	Cross-verified sea-pressure with wind history logs.
	•	Queried a backup coastal weather API.
	•	Reduced beam intensity to conserve power.
	•	Switched to emergency pulsing mode.

The cargo ship, Northern Star, detected the pulsing signal and adjusted course just in time.

By dawn, the storm had passed.
Astra logged the anomaly, flagged the wind sensor for repair, and returned to standard operation.

From that night onward, Astra didn’t just follow routines —
she adapted.
