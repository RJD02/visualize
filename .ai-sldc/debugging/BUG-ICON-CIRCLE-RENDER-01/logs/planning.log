KIND: debug
ID: BUG-ICON-CIRCLE-RENDER-01
PLAN_ID: PLAN-BUG-ICON-CIRCLE-RENDER-01
PHASE: planning
ACTION: Analyzed root cause of blue circle icon rendering bug
REASON: Evidence screenshots show blue circles overlapping text; code inspection reveals
        two-part root cause: (1) inline_use_references() drops position/scale from <use>
        elements, making brand icons invisible; (2) client-side iconRegistry.js injects
        simple circle-path placeholders for known icons like airflow.
OUTCOME: Draft plan PLAN-BUG-ICON-CIRCLE-RENDER-01.draft.md created with fix strategy,
         file scope, test plan, and rollback strategy.
NEXT_STATE: awaiting_approval
