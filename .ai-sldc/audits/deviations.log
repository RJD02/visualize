Original Plan Item: Run Cypress headless in testing phase using existing project config.

Why it failed: The environment did not have Cypress installed and project lacked a Cypress v10+ config (cypress.config.js) and support file. Initial run failed with "Could not find a Cypress configuration file".

Alternative chosen: Per agent autonomy rules, created `package.json` (devDependency on Cypress), added `cypress.config.js`, added `cypress/support/e2e.js`, removed legacy `cypress.json`, installed dependencies via `npm install`, and re-ran tests.

Risk impact: Low — changes add CI dev-dependencies and minimal config files; no changes to `src/` or production code. These modifications are logged and reversible (delete package.json, remove files, or revert commit).
